                <p> Hi, I'm Venkat ram reddy, My background includes a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering  from
                    Malla reddy college of engineering and Technology.  i have done certificaions courses programming languages such as
                    Java, as well as i have certification in database management and web development during
                    my coursework, internship,sand I'm always looking for opportunities to tackle
                    new challenges in the IT field.</p>
                <br>
                <p> I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology and
                    management here at the Illinois institute of technology. It's a pleasure to address you all today
                    and give you a glimpse into my journey and what lies ahead.

                    Looking beyond my degree, I have clear intentions for my future. My goal is to expand my expertise
                    full stack  development and become proficient in frontend technologies as well. This will allow
                    me to develop end-to-end solutions independently and contribute effectively to full-stack
                    development projects.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Before embarking on this academic journey, I was fortunate enough to have some prior experience in
                    programming and IT.

                    One of my hobbies that I'm deeply passionate about is playing cricket. Engaging in this sport
                    brings me immense joy and allows me to unwind and recharge.</p>

                <br>
                <p> I recently completed a website design course, and I'd like to share my experience with you. I
                    decided to take this course because I was interested in learning how to create visually appealing
                    and functional websites, which I believe is a valuable skill in today's digital age.

                <p>My immediate goal is to become proficient in the latest Full Stack technologies, including JavaScript
